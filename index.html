                    <p>Curiosity has been the throughline of my life&mdash;from dragging around an oversized atlas of the human body at six to crossing countries to study how minds and environments shape each other. I first trained in Occupational Therapy in India, where I saw how small design decisions in hospital rooms, homes, and communities could shift independence, recovery, and dignity.</p>
                    <p>That work left me with a question I couldn&apos;t shake: not just <em>what</em> people do, but <em>why</em> they do it within the systems they inherit. To answer it, I moved to the U.S. for a Master&apos;s in Applied Behavior Analysis and began treating campuses, classrooms, and platforms as living environments to be studied and re-designed.</p>
                    <p>I use the word <strong>strategy</strong>, not intervention, on purpose. An intervention is done <em>to</em> people; a strategy is built <em>with</em> them, into the systems they move through.</p>
